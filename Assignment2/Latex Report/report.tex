\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction section. Here you should introduce the topic of your report, provide some background information, and state the objectives of your work.

\section{Linear SVM }

This section discusses the hyperparameter tuning and results of a linear support vector machine implementation. 

\subsection{Optimal Tuning}
This model was tuned using K-fold Cross Validation and several values of C, the regularization parameter CHECK THIS SHIT. 
To find the optimal value of C, the following format was used B > 1 and C0 > 0 with C = C0 raised to the B * ith power where i is the iteration number. The optimal value for C with the lowest average loss for kfold validation where k = 10 with 2000 data points sampled from the original 12000 was 2.2 * 10^4 or 22193 or 1.1 ** 7*15.
